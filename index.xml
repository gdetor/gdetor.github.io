      <title>An introduction to self-organizing maps</title>

      <description>This post presents the classical self-organizing map algorithm proposed by Grossberg [1] and Teuvo Kohonen [2]. We explain the algorithm&amp;rsquo;s fundamental aspects and applications and offer a basic implementation in Pytorch.
Introduction Let us begin with a prevalent problem in science. We often have to deal with data that live in a high-dimensional space $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{R}^k$. When $k &amp;gt; 3$, things get rough for people who need help to visualize what&amp;rsquo;s happening.</description>

      <description>Abstract Technological advancements enable delicate and complex experiments on small-scale devices, such as organs-on-chips, improving and accelerating research. At the same time, an ever-increasing diversity of hardware platforms is accessible via cloud services. This perspective article describes our vision for the future of organs-on-chips. We present the main idea behind organs-on-chips as a cloud service, a brief description of the proposed infrastructure, and some applications.

      <title>Autocorrelation Functions for Time Series</title>
      <link>https://gdetor.github.io/posts/acf_pacf/</link>

      <description>This post aims to provide some theoretical background on autocorrelation functions and how to use them to analyze time series. Furthermore, we show how to use the Autocorrelation (ACF) function and the Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) function to determine the parameters for an ARMA model.
Brief introduction to time series In a previous post (see here), we introduced some basic definitions and terminology about time series. We repeat the same definitions here to avoid forcing the reader to move back and forth.</description>

      <guid>https://gdetor.github.io/posts/normalization/</guid>
      <description>This post briefly introduces fundamental data transformations such as mean subtraction (centering data), normalization, standardization, difference transform, and power transform. Furthermore, we provide simple examples of Python code for applying those transforms to real data. Moreover, we heavily rely on the sklearn Python package [1].
Mean subtraction Let&amp;rsquo;s assume we have some data in a vector $ {\bf x} $, and know that the mean value of $ {\bf x} $ is not zero.</description>

      <title>Time series forecasting error metrics</title>
      <link>https://gdetor.github.io/posts/errors/</link>

      <description>In this post, we will explore the basic error measures used in time-series forecasting. Error measures provide a way to quantify the quality of a forecasting algorithm (e.g., the performance). First, we briefly introduce time series and the fundamental terms of forecasting. Second, we will introduce the most commonly used error measures and give examples. Finally, we provide a complete example of using errors in a real-life forecasting scenario.
What is a time series A time series is a series of data points indexed in time order in layman&amp;rsquo;s terms [1, 2].</description>

      <guid>https://gdetor.github.io/posts/genetic_algorithms/</guid>
      <description>In this post, we explore genetic algorithms (GAs) and the so-called island model (IM). GAs and the IM are optimization methods used to maximize or minimize a cost function.
What is Optimization? Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example of an optimization problem we all face every day. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume you&amp;rsquo;d like to go and grab a couple of coffee from your favorite coffee shop. Typically, you ask Google to find the fastest way to the store from your current location.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Georgios Is. Detorakis, and Iâ€™m a computational neuroscientist (ðŸ§ ) and machine learning engineer (ðŸ¤–). On this website, you can find information about my research, any software I have developed, and some artwork related to neuroscience I have created over the years.
Currently, I am working as a full-time machine learning engineer developing algorithms for time-series analysis and forecasting (with applications in biosignals and financial data).
Here you can find my complete CV (or a less extensive rÃ©sumÃ©).</description>

      <description>Neuromorphic Computing Georgios was involved in developing neuromorphic devices capable of embedded and online learning. He was one of the core developers of the software simulator for the Neural and Synaptic Array Transceiver Framework (in collaboration with Intel Corporation Research Labs, the Universities of California Irvine, and San Diego). He investigated how natural mechanisms of biological brains can lead to more efficient and biologically plausible machine learning algorithms suitable for neuromorphic devices.</description>

Eigenvalue Level Repulsion Imaging we have two matrices ${\bf A}, {\bf B}$ $\in \mathbb{R}^n$, that are both symmetric. Then, we know that both matrices have $n$ eigenvalues (multiplicity). Let&amp;rsquo;s start now, gradually morphing ${\bf A}$ to ${\bf B}$ using the following formula
$$ {\bf A}[t] = (1 - t) {\bf A} + t {\bf B}, $$</description>
