      <description>Abstract Technological advancements enable delicate and complex experiments on small-scale devices, such as organs-on-chips, improving and accelerating research. At the same time, an ever-increasing diversity of hardware platforms is accessible via cloud services. This perspective article describes our vision for the future of organs-on-chips. We present the main idea behind organs-on-chips as a cloud service, a brief description of the proposed infrastructure, and some applications.
