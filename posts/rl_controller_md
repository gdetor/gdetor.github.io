This post will explore the world of control theory (CT) and how we can
build reliable controllers using reinforcement learning (RL). We first
introduce the concept of a controller, its use, and why it is essential
in practical applications. Next, we present some basic terms from the RL
and the Deep RL (DRL) fields. We will focus more on two algorithms, deep
Q-learning (DQL) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). Finally, we show
how to use them in real practical control problems. More precisely, we
investigate how we can control a continuous cart pole and the speed of
a car. 
 

## The shortest introduction to Control Theory (CT)

When we heavily use our computers, we notice the fun making a lot of
noise (working at high capacity). Our working overload causes the CPU
to operate at high frequencies, increasing the heat produced by the CPU.
For a good reason, the computer is equipped with heat sensors that read
the CPU's temperature and adjust the fans' speed so we will not burn out
our precious microchip. Under the hood there is a microcontroller that
reads the temperature from the sensors and adjust the fans speed based
on a reference temperature.

Problems like those mentioned above are typically part of a more general
scientific field called Control Theory (CT). Control theory combines
different areas such as mathematics and engineering to solve problems
where the output of a system needs to be driven to desired states.
In this post, we do not go into many details about CT. We only discuss
the concept of a controller and, most precisely, a closed-loop controller.
We will make a simple connection between control theory and reinforcement
learning. Moreover, we comment on how one can use the latter to control
a system.
